     <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
  Iâ€™m currently taking a 14-month break from school to focus on building my portfolio, saving money, and re-centering myself on my long-term goals. 
  During college, I found myself in a rut â€” uncertain, unfocused, and questioning if I was on the right path. 
  Stepping away gave me the clarity I needed. I used this time to dive deeper into my interests, develop real-world skills, and prove to myself that this field â€” technology, coding, AI â€” is truly what I want to pursue. 
  This website is the result of that turning point â€” a place to track my growth and showcase what Iâ€™m capable of.
</p>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4 mb-12">
        Iâ€™m serious about turning this time into something meaningful. Iâ€™m using it to sharpen my skills, build real-world tools, 
        and prepare myself for whatâ€™s next. This isnâ€™t just a break â€” itâ€™s a pivot.
      </p>
